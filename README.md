    decompile(input_file, output_file)

# Extract RPA archive
with open('archive.rpa', 'rb') as f:
    extract_rpa(f, './extracted/')
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Q: It always raise pickle `import ** \nModuleNotFoundError: No module named '**\*'` error.**

  A: It's because the our fake packages("renpy","store") is not contains the object you want to decompile. Please open an issue and tell us the renpy version and the rpyc file you want to decompile. Join our telegram group to get help also be better.
